PRIDICTIVE HEALTHACRE IN AMBULANCE USING AI & HUMAN INTERFACE COLLABORATION OR INTELLIGENT AMBULANCE USING AI & HUMAN INTERFACE TECHNOLOGY

ABSTRACT:
    The integration of technology in healthcare, including emergency services, has been an ongoing process. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, such as predictive analytics for disease outbreaks and medical image analysis, has paved the way for its implementation in ambulance services.. Human-machine interfaces have also evolved, with advancements in augmented reality, virtual reality, and natural language processing. The convergence of these technologies led to the development of intelligent ambulance-AI and human interface technology, which refers the integration of AI and advanced human-machine interfaces in ambulance services. The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and responsiveness of emergency medical services. Traditional ambulance systems typically rely on manual processes for call handling, dispatching, and patient care. Emergency calls are received by human operators, who then dispatch the nearest ambulance based on limited information. Paramedics assess the situation on-site, often with minimal data about the patient's medical history or condition. Communication between paramedics and hospitals might be limited, leading to delays in decision-making and treatment. In addition, the need for intelligent ambulance-AI and human interface technology arises from the critical nature of emergency medical services. Swift and accurate response during emergencies can significantly impact patient outcomes. Therefore, this research develops a system by implementing AI algorithms for predictive analytics, and decision support. By automating certain tasks and providing actionable insights, this technology significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of ambulance services, ensuring timely and optimal care for patients in critical situations. Further, this proposed system can automate processes, provide data-driven insights, and improve communication, ultimately saving lives and reducing the burden on healthcare facilities.
